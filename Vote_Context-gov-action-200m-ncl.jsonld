    "comment": "This gov action is to set the NCL for 2025, Epoch 532 to the end of Epoch 604. The Net Change Limit would be 200M ADA. \n\nI'm glad I/we waited for a smaller NCL proposal.\n1. Smarter decisions can be made when the mind is free to focus on something besides how much money is in the treasury. It's a flavor of freedom. \n2. I promised conservative voting and I believe $200m is low enough to keep everyone focused on conservation of funds and doing more with less whenever possible.\n2. A larger treasury can be a deciding factor for sustainability. Blockchain is still a highly volatile industry. 99% of the same players kept their jobs at the SEC. Cardano must remain prepared to weather any storm at any time. Central banks currently have a large financial advantage in lobbying, the SEC, IMF, etc.\n\nI hope the world sees and experiences the enormous value that developers and others have built into Cardano.\n\n"
