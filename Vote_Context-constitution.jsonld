    "comment": "At the time of my voting no, it has become obvious and mathematically impossible for our votes to count. However fortunate this may be I'm adding our previous questions with recommendations to this note for future review.\n\n1. Voting Mechanisms\nQuestion: What mechanisms exist to prevent vote buying or collusion among large ADA holders?\nProposed Constitutional Language:\nArticle X: Safeguards Against Voting Manipulation\nSection 1: \"Vote trading, buying, or selling shall be strictly prohibited. Any evidence of such actions shall result in immediate nullification of the vote and disqualification of the involved parties from governance for a minimum of five years.\"\nSection 2: \"Delegated Representatives (DReps) and Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) must disclose voting affiliations or agreements that influence their governance actions, subject to audit by a community oversight board.\"\n\n2. Delegated Representatives (DReps)\nQuestion: How can we verify that DReps act in the best interest of their delegators?\nProposed Constitutional Language:\nArticle XI: Accountability of Delegated Representatives\nSection 1: \"DReps must publish quarterly reports detailing voting activity, rationales, and alignment with delegatorsâ€™ interests.\"\nSection 2: \"Delegators retain the right to recall their delegation at any time. Persistent misalignment between DRep actions and delegator preferences may trigger an automatic re-election of the DRep.\"\n\n3. Constitutional Updates\nQuestion: How can we prevent harmful or rushed amendments?\nProposed Constitutional Language:\nArticle XII: Amendment Procedures\nSection 1: \"Amendments shall require a minimum 70% affirmative vote across all governance bodies (DReps, SPOs, and the Constitutional Committee) and a 30-day public review period before final ratification.\"\nSection 2: \"Emergency amendments bypassing this threshold may be introduced only with unanimous agreement from the Constitutional Committee and must expire within 90 days unless formally ratified.\"\n\n4. Transparency of Governance Actions\nQuestion: How can we ensure transparency in decision-making?\nProposed Constitutional Language:\nArticle XIII: Transparency and Auditing\nSection 1: \"All governance actions, including votes, proposals, and treasury disbursements, must be recorded on-chain and accessible to all community members in a human-readable format.\"\nSection 2: \"A quarterly audit of governance activities shall be conducted by an independent oversight body, with results publicly disclosed.\"\n\n5. Treasury Misuse\nQuestion: How can we prevent misuse of treasury funds?\nProposed Constitutional Language:\nArticle XIV: Treasury Safeguards\nSection 1: \"All treasury disbursements above 1% of the total treasury value require approval by a multi-signature mechanism involving at least three governance bodies.\"\nSection 2: \"Each funded proposal must submit periodic progress reports to remain eligible for ongoing funding.\"\n\n6. Stake Pool Collusion\nQuestion: What processes prevent collusion among SPOs?\nProposed Constitutional Language:\nArticle XV: Stake Pool Decentralization\nSection 1: \"No single SPO or group of SPOs may control more than 20% of the total network stake. Exceeding this threshold triggers a redistribution process enforced by the network protocol.\"\nSection 2: \"Stake redistribution penalties shall be enforced to disincentivize collusion and concentration of power.\"\n\n7. Onboarding and Education\nQuestion: How can we ensure new participants understand governance implications?\nProposed Constitutional Language:\nArticle XVI: Community Education\nSection 1: \"Participation in governance requires completion of an onboarding module detailing governance rights, responsibilities, and processes.\"\nSection 2: \"A public knowledge repository shall be maintained, offering up-to-date educational materials accessible to all stakeholders.\"\n\n8. Game Theoretical Exploits\nQuestion: How do we address game-theoretical vulnerabilities?\nProposed Constitutional Language:\nArticle XVII: Strategic Integrity\nSection 1: \"All governance mechanisms shall undergo regular stress-testing in simulated environments to identify vulnerabilities.\"\nSection 2: \"Any identified exploit shall trigger an immediate review by the Constitutional Committee, with the power to deploy emergency patches.\"\n\n9. Emergency Powers\nQuestion: What emergency powers are appropriate and how do we prevent abuse?\nProposed Constitutional Language:\nArticle XVIII: Emergency Governance\nSection 1: \"Emergency governance powers may be invoked only by unanimous agreement of the Constitutional Committee and must be ratified within 30 days by standard governance processes.\"\nSection 2: \"All actions taken under emergency governance shall be fully disclosed to the community within 7 days.\"\n\n10. External Influence\nQuestion: How can we prevent external actors from manipulating governance?\nProposed Constitutional Language:\nArticle XIX: Protection from External Manipulation\nSection 1: \"Participants acting under undue external influence, including coercion or bribery, shall be disqualified and penalized.\"\nSection 2: \"Governance rules shall include provisions to mitigate external funding sources from disproportionately affecting voting outcomes.\"\n\n11. Audit and Feedback Loops\nQuestion: How do we ensure ongoing refinement of the system?\nProposed Constitutional Language:\nArticle XX: Governance Audits\nSection 1: \"A biannual constitutional review shall be conducted by a community-elected audit committee, tasked with identifying vulnerabilities and recommending improvements.\"\nSection 2: \"Findings and recommendations from the audit shall be publicly shared, with actionable proposals submitted for governance approval.\"\n\n"
