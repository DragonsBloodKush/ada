    "comment": "I could have been convinced to move 5%.\n\nHere's some more balanced and deeper rationale behind the no vote by working with ai:\n\nAssumption of Future ADA Price Appreciation:\n\nThe proposal argues that the treasury’s sustainability will depend heavily on future ADA price appreciation rather than transaction volume growth. This is a risky assumption and a classic case of wishful thinking or appeal to future possibilities. If ADA’s price does not appreciate as expected, the treasury might face significant funding shortfalls, potentially jeopardizing long-term development, ecosystem funding, and governance initiatives.\n\nOveremphasis on Staking Incentives as a Decentralization Solution:\n\nThe argument that increasing staking rewards will necessarily lead to greater decentralization is a hasty generalization. While higher rewards may attract more participation, they do not guarantee that large stakeholders won’t dominate the system. Centralization risks may still persist if the top stakeholders continue to control a large portion of ADA, undermining the decentralization goal.\n\nEconomic Sustainability Risks:\n\nReducing the treasury cut reduces the immediate inflow of funds into the treasury, even if staking incentives increase. This could lead to a false dichotomy by presenting the choice as either incentivizing staking or maintaining treasury health, without thoroughly exploring hybrid solutions or incremental reductions that balance both priorities.\n\nMisleading Precedent with Plutus V3 Cost Model Update:\n\nDrawing a parallel between this economic adjustment and the Plutus V3 cost model update could be a false analogy. The Plutus update focused on technical optimizations with minimal economic impact, whereas treasury adjustments directly affect the network’s financial foundation. The procedural similarity does not guarantee similar outcomes or levels of risk.\nPotential Undermining of Treasury-Funded Development:\n\nThe proposal assumes that lower treasury funding will drive developers toward building transaction-heavy applications to secure funding through fees, which is an appeal to incentive fallacy. Developers might instead move to ecosystems with more immediate and guaranteed funding sources, especially during bearish market conditions when transaction volumes typically decline.\n\nIssues Arising from Voting For the Proposal\nTreasury Funding Shortfalls: If ADA price does not appreciate as predicted, the treasury may struggle to fund essential network improvements, community initiatives, and long-term development projects.\nShort-Term Gains vs. Long-Term Stability: Increasing staking rewards offers immediate benefits to stakers but could compromise the network’s ability to invest in future growth and innovation, leading to stagnation.\n\nRisk of Overdependence on Transaction Fees: A reduced treasury cut might shift the focus towards generating high transaction volumes, potentially leading to spam-like behaviors or prioritizing quantity over quality in network usage.\nIssues Arising from Voting Against the Proposal\n\nMissed Opportunity for Enhanced Participation: Maintaining the 20% cut could discourage smaller stakeholders from participating due to relatively lower rewards, potentially limiting decentralization and network security.\n\nPerceived Inertia in Governance: Rejecting the proposal might signal resistance to adapting economic parameters despite the evolving maturity of the ecosystem, potentially alienating community members seeking more dynamic governance.\n\nConstitutional and Governance Alignment Issues\nAlignment with Constitutional Guardrails: The proposal claims to align with the new constitution, which permits treasury cuts between 10% and 30%​. However, documents like Getting to a Minimum Viable Constitution and Beyond emphasize the importance of balancing immediate changes with long-term governance stability​.\n\nOversight and Accountability: The interim and future Constitutional Committees are tasked with ensuring economic sustainability​. A sudden change in treasury parameters might create additional burdens on these committees, especially if future adjustments are needed due to unforeseen economic impacts.\n\nDecentralized Governance Challenges: With the newly established governance framework under SIP 1694, there are ongoing efforts to stabilize governance processes​. A major economic parameter change during this transitional phase might introduce unnecessary complexity and strain on governance bodies."
