      "@value": "My motivations are based in a simple and long-held belief that digitizing money will change the world for the good of all. When I first saw Satoshi's whitepaper, I thought the world would change in a way that was similar to the way text, images, music and video changed the world. But I was wrong. I never dreamt I would need to get involved directly in governance actions beyond supporting P2P networks. I've since learned that the complexities required a deep academic approach supported by mathematics and engineering that needed to be invented across all disciplines. I'm motivated to see Cardano's approach catalyze the rest of the world into action without harm or financial retribution for one's beliefs. By becoming a DRep, I hope to be a sensible vote for those who cannot for whatever reason, vote for Cardano's core principles. "

    "objectives": {
      "@value": "My objectives are to learn, educate and vote sensibly. \n1. Learn - I will read proposals that strike me as capable of providing economic identity to the billions who lack it by providing decentralized applications to manage identity, value and governance.\n2. Educate - I will use my teaching experience to share facts that can shift perspectives towards understanding the needs and benefits to consumers.\n3. Voting Sensibly - To me, this means using my analytical ability to stay open to new ideas, distill relevant concepts, discern facts, lean on my personal intuition when necessary and vote accordingly.\n\nI will not always get it right. But I will always do my best."

Yet, somehow I am unstoppable in my pursuits.  "
